# DRPPM-PATH-SURVEIOR_Manuscript_Supplementary

To ensure reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility for the work we have done to develop the DRPPM-PATH-SURVEIOR suite of tools, we have arranged this github in tandem with our manuscript that we are working towards publication. Users may explore the code and figures from the use cases we worked on, including the TARGET AML drug screening and identification of immune pathways in melanoma patients.
